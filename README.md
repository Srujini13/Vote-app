## Decentralied Voting system 
This project implements a decentralized voting system using blockchain technology to provide secure, transparent, and tamper-proof voting. By leveraging blockchain's inherent features, such as immutability and decentralization, this system ensures that votes are recorded securely and cannot be altered or deleted. The system allows users to cast votes, and once recorded, the votes become part of a blockchain ledger that is accessible to all participants.

## Features
Blockchain-based Voting: Votes are recorded on a blockchain to ensure security and immutability.

Decentralized: The system operates on a peer-to-peer network, ensuring that there is no central authority controlling the voting process.

Transparent: Every vote is publicly accessible on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and trust.

Secure: Cryptographic methods and consensus algorithms protect against fraud and tampering.

Anonymous Voting: Voters can cast their votes anonymously while still ensuring their votes are counted.

## Tech Stack
Blockchain: Ethereum (or any other blockchain platform)

Smart Contracts: Solidity

Frontend: React.js (or any other frontend framework)

Backend: Node.js

Web3: Web3.js (for interacting with Ethereum blockchain)

Database: IPFS (for storing votes and records)

Authentication: MetaMask (for secure login and transaction signing)

## Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js

NPM (Node Package Manager)

MetaMask Wallet (for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain)

Ganache (for local blockchain testing)

Solidity Compiler (Remix IDE or Truffle)

Step 1: Clone the repository
Step 2: Install dependencies
Step 3: Set up the blockchain environment
Step 4: Configure the frontend
Step 5: Run the application
The frontend should now be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

## Usage
Register: Users can register by connecting their MetaMask wallet.

Vote: Once registered, users can cast their vote on a particular candidate or proposition.

Verify Vote: After voting, users can verify their vote on the blockchain by checking the transaction hash.

Count Votes: The smart contract automatically tallies the votes as they are cast, and the results are publicly available on the blockchain.
